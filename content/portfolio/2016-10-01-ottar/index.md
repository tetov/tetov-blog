This piece of furniture is titled Kämpa Ottar and is inspired by Ottar.

Elise ”Ottar” Ottesen Nielsen (1886-1973) was a sex educator, anarchist agitator and women right’s activist from Norway. She were very much a pioneer in these issues and fought hard to better the conditions for Scandinavia’s working class.

She worked as an journalist, writing her own columns and traveled through Sweden as a sex educator during a time when sex education was illegal.

Ottar worked tirelessly to improve the conditions of the working class women, to spread knowledge and awareness and for the rights to one’s own body and sexuality.

Steel and fiberglass.
