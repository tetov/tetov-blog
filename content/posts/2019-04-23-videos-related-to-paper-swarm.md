I've co-authored a paper together with David Andrén[^1], Ana Godeia[^2] and Erik Hildorson[^3] that has been accepted by the [Self-Organised Construction conference](https://vimeo.com/album/5917090) in Umeå this summer. I'm honestly not sure if I can publish the paper on this site (yet).

More videos found in this [album](https://vimeo.com/album/5917090).

The paper is titled _Swarm materialization through discrete, nonsequential additive fabrication_ and describes how a swarm of agents could be modeled using a dual approach of computer simulation and 3D-printing. The 3D-printing process and building proposal I created with Erik as part of our Master's studio Spatial Experiments I, during fall 2018, is described as a starting point for this proposed swarm modeling process.
