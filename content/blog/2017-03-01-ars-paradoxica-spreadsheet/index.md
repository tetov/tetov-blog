{{< figure src="code-spreedsheet.png" title="Deciphering spreadsheet" >}}

I listen to the beautiful audiodrama [Ars Paradoxica](https://arsparadoxica.com/). In the end of each episode a series of numbers are read. I put together a spreadsheet to decipher these, [take a look if you'd like](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g2tXvxwR4-Oumgf3H3ucRDdE90pUqfZpS65uwsC1dpw/edit?usp=sharing).

The cipher's used are [Vigen√©re](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/vigenere.php), [Caesarian shift](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/caesar.php) and [Atbash](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/atbash.php).

**Update:**
The spreadsheet contains deciphering methods for episode 1-23. I haven't solved the cipher for later episodes.
